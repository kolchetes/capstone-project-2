				<p>(Pro tip: the lamp turns on/off the dark mode)</p>
				<p>
					I'm an pessimistic but dreamy (if that makes any sense) 23 years old brazilian Web Development 
					student. As an web developer, I plan to make websites with minimal layouts, and make this my 
					signature.
				</p>
				<p>
					My dream goal is to become an indie game developer, and live from the money I earn from my games.
					My topics of interest are: games, programming, pixel art, underground cinemam, 80's songs and 
					minimalism, but I'm not a chatty person.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Oh... if you wandering why there's brackets in titles, its because kolchetes (colchetes actually) 
					means brackets in portuguese.

							<h3>Administration Experience</h3>

							<h3>Programming</h3>
							<p>
								I've been trying to learn code since I was 14 years old and found the program "RPG Maker"
								while searching on web "how to make games" but gave up multiple times due to life problems
								and demotivation. Now I'm trying to learn Web Design because people told me it's an good
								way to learn programming and found an job in the CS area. I've been doing some courses 
								like 
								<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"
								>freeCodeCamp</a> web dev curriculum
								and now Dr. Angela Yu's web dev course in 
								<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank"
								>Udemy</a>.

							<h3>Playing</h3>

								I've made it to diamond elo in LoL (<em>League of Legends</em>), reached
								level 80 on <em>Albion Online</em>, and got Yellow Star rank in RotMG

							<h3>Imagining Things</h3>
							<p>
								I'm an really creative person. My favorite pass time activity is to create imaginary
								scenarios in my mind. Sometimes I get too concerned on my imagination that I miss
								things that are happening in front of me!

							<h3>Drawning</h3>
							<p>
								I don't think I have to say it here since you are (probably) already seeing it, but 
								I'm an crazy good artist. I even got an award for the "Best Painter World 2024" in USA!
								Sadly, it was just another imaginary scenario that I've created while writing this section.
